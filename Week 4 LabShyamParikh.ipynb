Another reason why I am implementing this model is because the data is already preprocessed meaning that it is already feature scaled. This dataset that we are using isn't such a large dataset as its sample size is 1086 values. Missing Values were also removed from this dataset which makes this model usable in this situation. Also, if new data were to be added, the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm would not be affected. "

    "Companies issue bonds, which are debt securities, to raise funds that can be used to invest in the long-term future of the company. A corporate bond is a debt instrument from a company that investors can buy and, in doing so, pay the company the value of the bond upfront, which is called the principal amount. In return, the company pays the investor interest (called a coupon rate) on the bond's principal amount via periodic interest payments. At the bond's maturity date, which is typically in one to five years, the principal is paid back to the investor. Before investors buy a corporate bond, they need to know how financially stable the company that issued the bond is because this implies the ability of the company to pay back the bond obligations. Investors know this by looking at the bond ratings. \n",
    "\n",
    "According to Fitch Ratings,  bond rating of triple-A (AAA) signifies the highest investment grade and means that there is a very low credit risk. \"AA\" represents very high credit quality; \"A\" means high credit quality, and \"BBB\" is a satisfactory credit quality. These ratings are considered to be investment grade, which means that the security or entity being rated carries a high-enough quality level for most financial institutions to make investments in those securities. \"BBB\" is the lowest rating of investment-grade securities, while ratings below \"BBB\", like \"C\" or \"D\" is the lowest or junk quality.  \n",

Your subordinates gathered some financial metrics (e.g., current ratio, asset turnover) of 593 companies for you from 1/10/2014 to 9/9/2016. This data set is in the \"corporate_rating.csv\" file. Your goal is to predcit the bond ratings of companies that exhibit different financial properties based on these metric values. \n",

    "For the first model, I will be implementing a Support Vector Machine using an RBF Kernel. This model will be efficient as this is a high dimensional space as there are many ratings that are going to be classified. The dataset that we are using is also not super large which makes it efficient to test on. Also for the dataset, there is not much noise, as we have preprocessed the data making it normalized and standardized.  The number of training data samples is also greater than the number of features for each training data point. This SVC(RBF Kernel) is also memory efficient which makes it a good model to use in this example. "

    "For the second model, I am implementing a random forest model. The random forest model reduces the overfitting issue that is present in the decision tree model. It also reduces variance and improves the accuracy. The only issues with this model is that it takes more time to model, and it's computationally costly with more decision trees. The more decision trees, the more stabilized the algorithm is. This model is also strong and robust to outliers which makes it good to use. "

In our data, we are looking at A level, B level, BB level, and BBB level bond ratings.\n",

    "The Random Forest Model Maintained a higher training and testing accuracy than the SVC(RBF) model. With a testing accuracy of 0.509 and a testing error of 0.491, the Random Forest Model is not super accurate but is relatively accurate as compared to the SVC model. The Support Vector Machine model with an RBF Kernel has a testing accuracy of 0.362 and testing error of 0.638. This is significantly less accurate than the Random Forest Model. \n",

    "The next key performance metric that we are looking at is the F1 score. For the random forest classifier, the model had a slightly better than average predictor for a BBB Bond rating with a 0.55, but a weak and below average for A,B, and BB Bonds. The F1 scores were 0.47, 0.49, and 0.45 respectively.  The SVC(RBF) classifier has weaker ratings for each bond rating prediction. This classifier has an F1 score of 0 for A,B, and BB bonds and 0.53 for BBB Bonds.  The weighted F1 score for the Random Forest Classifier is 0.50 while the weighted F1 score for the SVC(RBF) Classifier is 0.19. This is able to imply that although the Random Forest Classifier is an average predictor for Bond Ratings, it is a significantly better Predictor than the SVC(RBF Classifier. )\n",

On the other hand, the SVC(RBF) Classifier has an AUC OF 0.643 which also suggests that this classifier is abover the average but not by a great amount.

A high bond rating will likely indicate that a stock price will go up in the future as the company is financially stable and is attempting to put more money into the future of the corporation. If a company is more financially stable, it has more room to grow as it's stock price likely has a high floor and a high ceiling.  A low bond rating would indicate that a company is less credible and is not so financially stable. This would indicate that the stock may not perform as well in the future as the stock with the high bond rating. Bond Ratings and stock prices are positively correlated with one another. "
